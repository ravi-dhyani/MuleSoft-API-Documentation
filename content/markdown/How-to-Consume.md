**Step 1**: Review API Documentation
To get started, go to the Developer Portal and review the information.

**Step 2**: Request API Access for an Application
The first step is to register your applications with the API. At the top of the page click the “Request API access” button.

Either:
1. Select one of your existing applications (if you have already requested access for other APIs)
or
2. Add a “new application”.
Please refer the [How to Request Access?](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-exchange/to-request-access) page for more details.

**Step 3**: Access Approval
Your access request will be assessed and once approved, you will receive an email containing a link to a page in the Developer Portal that will provide a client ID and client secret that you can use to access the API.
